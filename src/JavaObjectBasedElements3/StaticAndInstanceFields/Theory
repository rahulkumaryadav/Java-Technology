    The static can be:
    1.Static Variables
    2.Static Methods
    3.Static Blocks Of Code.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1.Static variables
    Static variable in java is variable which belong to class and initialize once at the start of execution.
    It is a variable which belong to class and not to object(instance)
    Static variable initialize only once, at the start of execution.
    These variable will be initialize first, before initialization of instance variables.
    A static variable can be access directly by class name and does not need any object.


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.Static Methods
    Static method in java is method which belong to class not object(instance).A static method can access only static data.
    It is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object(instance)
    A static method can access only static data. It can not access non-static data (instance variables)
    A static method can call only other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it.
    A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesnâ€™t need any object
    A static method cannot refer to "this" or "super" keywords in anyway
