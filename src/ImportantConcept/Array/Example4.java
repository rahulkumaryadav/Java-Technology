    //ultimately have an array with 106,81,26,15,5 in it.
    //Setup the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard.
    //implement the following method- getIntegers,printArray and sortIntergers
    //getIntegers returns an array of entered interges form keyboard
    //printArray prints out the content of the array
    //and sortIntergers should sort the array and return a new array conatining the sorted numbers
    //you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements form passed array into a new
    //array and sort them and returns the new sorted array.
