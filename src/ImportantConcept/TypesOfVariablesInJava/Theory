    Types of variable in java
    Premitive variables --------->used to represents primitive values
    Refrence variables------------>used to refer objects


    On the basis of position and declaration these variable is further classified in following type
    Intstance variable
    class/static variables
    Local variables


    Instance variables :
    Instance variables are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block.
    As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
    Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.
    Value of variable varies from object to objects.
    Can not be accessed from static area directly

    class/static variables:
    values is not varies from object to object
    know as class level variables

     Local variables :
     Created inside a block,constructure or methods
     initialization is necessary before using it.
     These variable are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.
     The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these variable only within that block.
